# Bryan's Weapons

What was originally intended as a library for creating Hideous Destructor weapons has turned into a modern tactical weapons pack. These weapons come with the benefit of some modularity, allowing for weapon attachments such as scopes, muzzle, and a miscellaneous flashlight attachments.

## Game Options

Options for this mod can be found in at the bottom of the default GZdoom options menu.

### Replace Mode

- None: Weapons from this mod will not spawn in levels. Gear can only be obtained via the loadout manager.
- Replace: Hideous Destructor weapon spawns will be replaced with weapons from this mod.
- Map: Weapons are only replaced at the start of the level.

WARNING: Vanilla loadouts and certain vanilla weapons will not function properly if using replace mode. This is intended to replace the default weapons entirely. It is still possible to spawn vanilla items via the loadout manager, but they will not function properly. If you want to use both weapons, play using map start or map mixed. The following items are replaced:

- Pistol with the Glock
- SMG with the MP5
- ZM66 with the M4
- Liberator with the M14
- Chaingun with the M249
- D.E.R.P. robot with the F.H. robot
- T.H.E.R.P. robot

Also note that other mods that spawn or replace actors if using "Replace" mode may continue to spawn even though they should be replaced. You'll be able to pick up these items and use them, but dropping them will trigger a replacement.

- None: Enemies will not spawn.

## Ammo

Each weapon has its own magazine/drum/pouch. The Glock and MP5 are chambered in the the default Hideous Destructor 9mm bullet. The Fauxtech Origin also reuses the default Hideous Destructor shotgun shells. Ammo for the M203 uses the default rocket grenade ammo as well.

</p>

- Glock magazine (9mm): 15 rounds
- MP5 magazine (9mm): 30 rounds
- M4 magazine (5.56mm): 30 rounds
- M14 magazine (7.62mm): 20 rounds
- Fauxtech drum (12 gauge): 20 shells
- M249 pouch (5.56mm): 200 rounds
- M107 magazine (.50 cal) 10 rounds
- AKM magazine (7.62mm): 30 rounds
- AKS74u magazine (5.45mm): 30 rounds
- Uzi magazine (9mm): 30 rounds

For the M249 pouch, a reloading tool is available. It is similar to the 7mm reloader. It needs an empty M249 magazine and loose 5.56 rounds.

## Using Attachments

Attachments will either be found in backpacks or already equipped on weapons dropped by enemies. An attachment must be compatible with the weapon to be able to attach it. To swap an attachment, simply use an attachment item. It will remove the attachment already occupying the slot, place it back in your inventory, and attach the item just used. 

There is a keybind available for removing each attachment in the options for opening an attachment manager.

## Loadout Manager

Weapons are configured based on the follow syntax: `w## ba# bs# bm#`. The values for input are shown below.

- `w##` is the weapon reference number
- `ba#` is the muzzle attachment reference number
- `bs#` is the sight attachment reference number
- `bm#` is the misc. attachment reference number

It's possible via the loadout manager to place attachments on weapons that otherwise wouldn't be supported. This is a known issue. You can remove the attachment, but you won't be able to put it back on later. Putting chokes on weapons other than the Fauxtech Origin will have no effect.

Magazines for weapons correspond to their weapon number, except for the M203 weapon variants. 

- `m01`: Glock magazine
